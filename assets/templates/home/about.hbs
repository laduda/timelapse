		 <div class="about"><h3>For curious, creators, adventurers.</h3>
		 <p><a href="http://www.timelapsr.com/" title="Go to timelapsr.com home page">Timelapsr.com</a> is made to fulfill one's desire to discover and share the world through the lense of timelapse photography. Get a sneak peek of your next travel destination, or check out your new friends' hometown with a unique and accessible hub made especially for those of us whose thirst for adventure is never quenched. </p> 
		<p>The idea came to life at the very moment founder, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/alexeyladuda" title="Alexey's LinkedIn profile" target="_blank">Alexey Laduda</a> finished watching this very time-lapse video of his hometown (above). "Seeing my city through the lens of time-lapse photography felt mind blowing. Hundreds of memories were brought up instantly. I discovered a beautiful tool to help me show where I am from and discover places I wanted to go."</p>
		<p>Digging deeper, Alexey found an enormous community behind the videos. He thought, "There's a wonderful chance to bring curious and creators together in one place and I'd like to give it a shot."</p> 
		<p>UrbanTimelapse currently lives in Prague since Alexey and his wife, Marina, relocated there recently.
